Space invaders alike game to build to reinforce js knowledge adquire in Ironhack bootcamp


Hi there!

I created this game in order to develop my javascript skills. 
Fell free to play and to give me feedback.


The main propose it was to use javascript canvas and Dom Manipulation in order to reinforce the concepts I've learned before. 
It has some bugs (check the colisions) but it keeps it's purpose.
